# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this credit risk analysis is to evaluate the performance of a **Logistic Regression** model in predicting the risk associated with loans. The analysis aims to classify loans into two categories: healthy loans under 0 and high-risk loans under 1. Here, we have used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 

## Results
* Accuracy Score: 0.99
     
* Precision Score:
       
  Healthy Loan (0): 0.99
  High-Risk Loan (1): 0.84
       
* Recall Score:

  Healthy Loan (0): 0.99
  High-Risk Loan (1): 0.94

  ## Summary

  The results indicate that the Logistic Regression model is highly effective at predicting healthy loans (0), achieving perfect precision and an exceptionally high recall. For high-risk loans (1), the model performs well overall; however, there is a noticeable drop in precision, suggesting that it may misclassify some healthy loans as high-risk. In conclusion, we can confidently recommend the Logistic Regression model for use by the company to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.
